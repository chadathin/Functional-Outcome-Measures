# Functional Outcome Measure Scorer

- Uses Flask to create web app in which clinicians (typically Physical Therapists) can have a patient
complete a functional outcome measure. These measures are used to objectify a patient's current
degree of impairment or functionality. The therapist will then have the option of storing the
score in a database. That score will be associated with a random string of characters which can be
searched later to retrieve the previous measure score.

- The primary goal of this project is to simply practice Flask and database interactions.
